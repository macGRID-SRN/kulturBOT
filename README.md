kulturBOT
=========

kulturBOT is a small floor bound robot which crawls it's way through art galleries and museums. At it's core kulturBOT is an art critic, you may hear it reciting phrases from The Futurist Manifesto because it is.

Project Road Map
=========

We want to keep kulturBOT as simple as possible. Our overall plan is to incrementally add new features and functionality as outline below.

**Version 1**
This is the first version which we consider an early prototype. This is the *bare minimum* functionality required.

- [ ] Raspberry Pi mounted on the iRobot Create
- [ ] Pi Cam mounted such that it's FOV is pointed straight
- [ ] Pi using a 5V step down board (borrowed from hitchBOT) to bring the build in NiCad's down for use with the Pi
- [ ] Backend Server (not sure the implementation details yet) which will receive the pictures from Pi Cam via WiFi. Store them accordingly.
- [ ] Run iRobot Create in it's various 'demo' modes. This will require no interfacing from the Pi.

- [ ] **Version 1**

**Shopping List**

- [ ] Raspberry Pi x2
- [ ] Pi Cam x2
- [ ] WiFi Dongle x2
- [ ] WiFi Router - Extended Range Preferred
- [ ] Standalone Computer/Server to run backend.

**Version 2**

*specs coming soon!*
